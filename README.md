**TIC-TAC-TOE**

_GOALS ACOMPLISHED_

- Built a web application for a game tic-tac-toe
- It keeps track of points
- Detects if there is a draw or a win
- It renders in a browser (its mobile responsive ish (by accident really))
- I tried to keep things simple and not repeating, so i have multiple functions
- I added separate files for interacting with the DOM and for the database + data manipulation
- I deployed the game [online](aleksanderbrymora.github.io/project0)
- I added some css and jQuery animations
- I started to work on the AI, but have not yet finished. I added logic to respond to the first move and I'm researching minmax method to create the rest of the ai
